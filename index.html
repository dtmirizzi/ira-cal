    <h2>Why you wasted your time calculating this?</h2>
    <p> 
        Pretty simply its more than likely not worth your time to correctly put your maxes into these accounts. <br>
        The best way forward imo is just to put all of your yearly money into and Trad IRA if you are in these income ranges.<br>
        At the end of the year just perform a backdoor roth conversion. This will simplfy your life and really will only increase your tax burden by the 
        invested gain from the last year. In most cases that may be a tax burden of less thank $500.<br>
        <br>
        I am not a finnacial advisor, just a beleiver that its just better to keep your finnances simple.
